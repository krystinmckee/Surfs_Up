# Surfs_Up
Module 9

### Overview of the analysis: 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.
- The purpose of this analysis is to supplement the climate insights previously provided to W. Avy. The information gleamed from such analyses is intended as part of a greater market analysis to help inform whether a Surf/Ice Cream shop will be successful in Oahu, HI.

### Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

- The average temperature in December is only 3 degrees (F) lower than the average temperature in June. This is good news for the shop as the average winter weather appears not to be too different from Summer weather.
- The data sample for June provides 17000 records, and the data sample for December provides 1517 records. This is noteworthy because it is important to have a data sample that is large enough to be considered representative. In this case, the amount of data available is significant enough to gain valuable insights from.
- The standard deviation of temperatures in December is 3.75, while the standard deviation is 3.26 in June. This indicates a greater variation of temperature in the winter, however, the difference is not so significant that it should drastically impact sales throughout the month of December.

### Summary: 
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

- Overall, the analysis shows that the temperature in December will be slightly colder, and there may be a bit more variability in temperature throughtout the month than can be expected in June. That said, it does not seem as though the the change in weather will be substantial enough to impact the amount of traffic to the shop.
